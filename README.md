# DeepLearning Course

These are the homeworks for the deep learning course.

The topics including: 

- Naive NN on MNIST dataset using stochastic gradient descent (CPU training);

- Convolution NN with one hidden layer of Logistic Regression on MNIST dataset using stochastic gradient descent (CPU training);

- Deep Convolution NN on CIFAR10 dataset (GPU training): features include (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop or ADAM,  (C) data augmentation;

- ResNet on CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet datasets (GPU training): features include (A) build my own ResNet-18 for CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, (B) Pretrained-ResNet18 for CIFAR100 dataset, (C) Distributed Training with both Synchronized mode and Asynchronized mode;
